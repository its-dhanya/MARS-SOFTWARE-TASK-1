# MARS-SOFTWARE-TASK-1
LIGHT DOSE:
I installed linux in my PC. I went through the Basic commands, I kept this task for last, but didnt get time to learn it completely.

MEDIUM DOSE:
I went through the transition between C to C++. Though I didnt get much time to explore, I got a basic outline of C++ and OOPS. Referred a youtube crash course video for the same.

STRONG DOSE:
The first question, I felt it was logic based, I knew Python already, so went with it.
For the second question, I got a clear idea on Image processing libraries, how to import and use them.
